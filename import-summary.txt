ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea/
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/scopes/
* .idea/scopes/scope_settings.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* app/
* app/.DS_Store
* app/src/
* app/src/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/
* app/src/main/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/java/
* app/src/main/java/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/java/com/
* app/src/main/java/com/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/java/com/lazztech/
* app/src/main/java/com/lazztech/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/res/
* app/src/main/res/.DS_Store
* app/src/main/res/drawable/
* app/src/main/res/drawable/.DS_Store
* build/
* build/intermediates/
* build/intermediates/model_data.bin
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
